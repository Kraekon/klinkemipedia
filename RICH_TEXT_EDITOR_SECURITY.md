# Rich Text Editor Security Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the security considerations and measures implemented for the rich text editor feature in Klinkemipedia.

## Security Audit Date
**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Tool**: GitHub CodeQL
**Result**: ✅ All security alerts resolved - 0 vulnerabilities found

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. Incomplete Multi-Character Sanitization (js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization)

#### Initial Issue
Three locations were flagged for using regex-based HTML tag removal that could potentially reintroduce dangerous sequences:

1. **Location**: `src/components/ArticleEditor.js:51`
   - **Code**: `text.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').trim()`
   - **Context**: Extracting plain text for word count statistics
   - **Risk**: Low (output not rendered as HTML, only used for counting)

2. **Location**: `src/pages/ArticleEditorPage.js:167`
   - **Code**: `htmlContent.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').trim()`
   - **Context**: Extracting summary text from HTML content
   - **Risk**: Low (output not rendered as HTML, only used for text extraction)

3. **Location**: `src/pages/MyDrafts.js:85`
   - **Code**: `html.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').trim()`
   - **Context**: Extracting plain text for draft preview
   - **Risk**: Low (output not rendered as HTML, only used for display)

#### Resolution
Replaced regex-based HTML stripping with `DOMParser` for safer HTML-to-text conversion:

```javascript
// Before (flagged by CodeQL)
const plainText = html.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').trim();

// After (secure)
const doc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(html, 'text/html');
const plainText = (doc.body.textContent || '').trim();
```

**Benefits of DOMParser approach**:
- Native browser API for HTML parsing
- Properly handles nested tags
- Prevents script execution
- More reliable text extraction
- No regex-based string manipulation vulnerabilities

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Content Security

#### XSS Protection
- **React Default Protection**: All user input rendered through React's virtual DOM, which automatically escapes content
- **TinyMCE Integration**: Editor output sanitized by TinyMCE's built-in security features
- **DOMParser Usage**: Safe HTML-to-text conversion for statistics and previews
- **No dangerouslySetInnerHTML** in untrusted contexts (only used in preview mode for admin-authored content)

#### HTML Sanitization
- Preview mode uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` only for content created by authenticated admins
- All HTML content goes through TinyMCE, which has built-in XSS protection
- Backend validation ensures only authorized users can create/edit content

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

#### Route Protection
```javascript
<Route path="/admin/editor/new" element={
  <ProtectedRoute requireAdmin={true}>
    <ArticleEditorPage />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

- All editor routes protected with `ProtectedRoute` HOC
- Requires `requireAdmin={true}` - only administrators can access
- Backend APIs verify user authentication via JWT tokens/cookies

#### API Security
- Draft APIs use `protect` middleware (backend/middleware/auth.js)
- User-scoped drafts (users can only access their own drafts)
- Media upload requires authentication
- CSRF protection through cookie-based authentication

### 3. Input Validation

#### Client-Side Validation
- **Required Fields**: Title, category, content must be filled
- **Category Whitelist**: Only predefined categories allowed
- **File Type Validation**: Images only (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- **Field Length Limits**: Title (200 chars), Summary (500 chars)

#### Backend Validation
- **File Size Limit**: 5MB maximum for uploads
- **File Type Checking**: MIME type and extension validation
- **Image Processing**: Sharp library validates and optimizes images
- **Rate Limiting**: Express rate limiter prevents abuse

### 4. Data Privacy

#### User Data Protection
- Drafts associated with user ID, not accessible by other users
- Auto-deletion of drafts after 30 days (model-level TTL index)
- No sensitive user data stored in drafts metadata

#### Navigation Guards
- Warns users before leaving with unsaved changes
- Prevents accidental data loss
- No data transmitted without user action

### 5. Upload Security

#### Image Upload Protection
```javascript
fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
  const allowedTypes = /jpeg|jpg|png|gif|webp/;
  const extname = allowedTypes.test(path.extname(file.originalname).toLowerCase());
  const mimetype = allowedTypes.test(file.mimetype);
  
  if (mimetype && extname) {
    return cb(null, true);
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed'));
  }
}
```

- File type validation (extension and MIME type)
- File size limits enforced
- Unique filename generation prevents overwrites
- Image optimization with Sharp (prevents malformed image attacks)
- Upload directory outside web root

### 6. Session Security

#### Auto-Save Security
- Debounced to prevent request flooding (2-second delay)
- Only triggers when content changes
- Authenticated requests only
- Error handling prevents information leakage

#### Token Management
- JWT/cookie-based authentication
- Credentials sent with `withCredentials: true`
- Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure in production)
- Token expiration enforced

## Potential Security Considerations

### 1. Trust Model
**Consideration**: The editor is designed for administrators who are trusted users.
- **Mitigation**: Admin-only access enforcement
- **Risk Level**: Low (admins already have elevated privileges)

### 2. Content Storage
**Consideration**: HTML content stored in database without additional sanitization.
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Only admins can create content
  - TinyMCE provides initial sanitization
  - React escapes content on render
- **Risk Level**: Low (trusted content source)

### 3. Image Uploads
**Consideration**: Uploaded images could contain malicious metadata or be oversized.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Sharp strips EXIF data during optimization
  - File size limits enforced
  - MIME type validation
  - Files stored outside public web root
- **Risk Level**: Low (multiple layers of protection)

### 4. Draft Data Persistence
**Consideration**: Draft content stored in database could accumulate.
- **Mitigation**:
  - 30-day auto-deletion TTL
  - User-scoped access only
  - No PII stored in metadata
- **Risk Level**: Low (managed lifecycle)

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Editor only accessible to admins
2. ✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers (client + server)
3. ✅ **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
4. ✅ **Output Encoding**: React's default XSS protection
5. ✅ **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforced (production)
6. ✅ **Error Handling**: Generic error messages, no information leakage
7. ✅ **Dependency Management**: Latest secure versions of packages
8. ✅ **Code Review**: CodeQL automated security analysis

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Enable HTTPS**: Ensure all traffic uses TLS/SSL
2. **Configure CSP**: Add Content-Security-Policy headers
3. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor and adjust rate limits based on usage
4. **Audit Logs**: Log all content creation/modification actions
5. **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups for draft recovery
6. **Monitoring**: Alert on unusual upload patterns or API errors
7. **TinyMCE Licensing**: Obtain proper license for production use
