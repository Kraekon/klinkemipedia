# Gamification System - Security Summary

## Security Analysis

This document summarizes the security considerations and mitigations implemented for the user profiles and gamification system.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. Rate Limiting

**Issue**: Multiple routes were missing rate limiting protection, making them vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.

**Mitigations Implemented**:
- **Badge Routes**: Added rate limiter (100 requests per 15 minutes) to public badge listing endpoint
- **Notification Routes**: Added rate limiter (30 requests per minute) to all notification endpoints
- **User Profile Routes**: Added rate limiter (100 requests per 15 minutes) to public profile routes
- **Follow Actions**: Already had specific rate limiter (10 requests per minute) implemented

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. SQL Injection / Query Injection

**Issue**: The leaderboard query was building MongoDB queries from user-provided values without proper validation.

**Mitigations Implemented**:
- Added input validation with whitelist approach for `period` parameter (only allows: 'all-time', 'month', 'week')
- Added input validation with whitelist approach for `category` parameter (only allows: 'reputation', 'articles', 'helpful')
- Added bounds checking for `page` and `limit` parameters
- Used a whitelist mapping for sort fields instead of directly using user input

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. XSS Through DOM

**Issue**: CodeQL flagged a potential XSS vulnerability where avatar preview URL could be reinterpreted as HTML.

**Analysis**: This is a false positive because:
- React automatically escapes attribute values in JSX
- The `avatarPreview` variable is either from `URL.createObjectURL()` (trusted) or from `user.avatar` (server-provided)
- Avatar uploads are restricted to image types only (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- File size is limited to 2MB

**Mitigations**:
- Added documentation comment explaining the safety of this usage
- Avatar upload validation ensures only image files are accepted
- Server-side validation in multer configuration

**Status**: ✅ Documented (False Positive)

### 4. Missing CSRF Protection

**Issue**: Cookie middleware is serving requests without explicit CSRF token validation.

**Analysis**: 
- JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies provide some CSRF protection
- Tokens can only be sent by the same origin due to CORS configuration
- For production deployment, explicit CSRF tokens would provide additional security

**Recommendation**: For production, consider implementing CSRF tokens using libraries like `csurf`.

**Status**: ⚠️ Accepted Risk (Comment Added)

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Role-based access control (user, contributor, admin)
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Admin-only routes for badge awarding

### Input Validation
- Avatar upload restrictions:
  - File types: JPG, PNG, GIF only
  - Maximum file size: 2MB
  - File type validation via MIME type and extension
- Bio field limited to 500 characters
- Username validation (3-30 characters)
- Email format validation with regex
- Password minimum length (6 characters)

### Rate Limiting
- Follow/unfollow actions: 10 per minute
- Public user routes: 100 per 15 minutes
- Notification routes: 30 per minute
- Badge routes: 100 per 15 minutes

### Data Protection
- Passwords excluded from query results by default
- Email addresses not exposed in public profiles
- Personal information only visible to profile owner

### CORS Configuration
- Restricted origin to frontend URL
- Credentials allowed for authenticated requests
- Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

## Best Practices Followed

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only edit their own profiles
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation (client + server)
3. **Secure Defaults**: Conservative rate limits and file size restrictions
4. **Input Sanitization**: Whitelist approach for query parameters
5. **Password Security**: Current password required for password changes
6. **Rate Limiting**: Aggressive limits on sensitive operations

## Known Limitations

1. **CSRF Protection**: Not explicitly implemented (relies on JWT + CORS)
2. **Avatar Storage**: Currently stored locally (consider CDN/cloud storage for production)
3. **No Email Verification**: Email addresses are not verified (future enhancement)
4. **Session Management**: No session timeout enforcement (JWT expiration handles this)

## Production Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Implement explicit CSRF token validation
2. Add email verification for new accounts
3. Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
4. Add logging and monitoring for security events
5. Use HTTPS only in production
6. Implement stricter rate limits based on production traffic

### Medium Priority
1. Add two-factor authentication support
2. Implement password strength requirements
3. Add suspicious activity detection
4. Implement IP-based blocking for abuse
5. Add audit logging for admin actions

### Low Priority
1. Implement password expiration policy
2. Add CAPTCHA for public actions
3. Implement honeypot fields for bot detection
4. Add geolocation-based security features

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct security testing before production deployment
2. **Rate Limit Testing**: Verify rate limiters work as expected under load
3. **Input Validation Testing**: Test boundary conditions and edge cases
4. **Authentication Testing**: Verify JWT expiration and refresh logic
5. **Authorization Testing**: Ensure role-based access controls work correctly

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement monitoring for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious user behavior patterns
- File upload attempts with invalid types
- Admin action logs
- Badge award events

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Users should be able to export/delete their data
- **Data Retention**: Implement policies for inactive accounts
- **Privacy**: Ensure profile visibility settings are respected
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of user actions for compliance

## Conclusion

The gamification system has been implemented with security as a priority. All critical vulnerabilities identified by CodeQL have been addressed. The system is ready for development/testing deployment, with clear recommendations for production hardening.

For production deployment, prioritize implementing CSRF protection and the high-priority recommendations listed above.
