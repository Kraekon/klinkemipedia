## Error Handling Tests

### Image Upload Errors

1. **No file selected**: Try to upload without selecting a file
   - Expected: "No image file provided" error

2. **Network error**: Stop the backend server and try to upload
   - Expected: Connection error message

3. **Large file**: Upload file > 5MB
   - Expected: "File size exceeds 5MB limit"

4. **Invalid type**: Upload a .pdf file
   - Expected: "Invalid file type" error

### Version History Errors

1. **Non-existent revision**: Request version 999 that doesn't exist
   - Expected: 404 "Revision not found"

2. **Invalid article**: Request revisions for non-existent article
   - Expected: 404 "Article not found"

3. **Invalid comparison**: Compare with invalid version numbers
   - Expected: 400 "Both v1 and v2 version numbers are required"

---

## Performance Testing

### Image Upload Performance

1. Upload images of various sizes:
   - Small (< 100KB): Should upload instantly
   - Medium (500KB - 1MB): Should upload in 1-2 seconds
   - Large (3-5MB): Should upload in 3-5 seconds

2. **Verify**:
   - âœ… Progress bar updates smoothly
   - âœ… No UI blocking during upload
   - âœ… Upload completes successfully

### Version History Performance

1. Create 50+ revisions for an article
2. Open version history
3. **Verify**:
   - âœ… List loads in < 2 seconds
   - âœ… Pagination is smooth
   - âœ… No lag when viewing specific revisions

---

## Browser Compatibility Testing

Test on multiple browsers:
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari

**Features to test:**
1. Image drag & drop
2. File picker
3. Modal animations
4. Version history UI
5. Side-by-side comparison view

---

## Mobile Testing

Test on mobile devices or browser dev tools mobile mode:

1. **Image Upload**:
   - âœ… Upload button is accessible
   - âœ… File picker opens correctly
   - âœ… Preview displays properly
   - âœ… Modal is responsive

2. **Version History**:
   - âœ… Version history button is accessible
   - âœ… Modal is scrollable
   - âœ… Table is responsive
   - âœ… Buttons are touchable

---

## Security Testing

### File Upload Security

1. **Path Traversal**: Try uploading with malicious filename like `../../etc/passwd.jpg`
   - Expected: Filename is sanitized

2. **Script Injection**: Try uploading image with script in filename
   - Expected: Special characters are removed

3. **MIME Type Spoofing**: Rename a .txt file to .jpg
   - Expected: Upload rejected based on actual MIME type

### Version History Security

1. Test without authentication (if implemented)
   - Expected: Protected endpoints require authentication

2. Test with SQL injection in query parameters
   - Expected: MongoDB ODM prevents injection

---

## Cleanup

After testing:

1. **Remove test images**:
   ```bash
   rm backend/public/uploads/*
   ```

2. **Clean test data** from MongoDB:
   ```bash
   mongo
   use klinkemipedia
   db.articles.deleteMany({ title: /test/i })
   db.articlerevisions.deleteMany({})
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Images not displaying
- Check static file serving is configured: `app.use('/uploads', express.static(...))`
- Verify image exists in `backend/public/uploads/`
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### Revisions not being created
- Check PUT endpoint is saving revisions before updating
- Verify ArticleRevision model is imported correctly
- Check MongoDB for `articlerevisions` collection

### Version History not loading
- Verify article exists and has revisions
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify backend routes are registered

---

## Success Criteria

All features are working correctly if:

âœ… Images can be uploaded via drag & drop or file picker
âœ… Images are displayed in articles
âœ… File validation works (type and size)
âœ… Revisions are automatically created on article updates
âœ… Version history lists all revisions
âœ… Specific revisions can be viewed
âœ… Two versions can be compared side-by-side
âœ… Previous versions can be restored
âœ… No errors in browser console
âœ… No errors in server logs
âœ… Build completes successfully
âœ… All API endpoints return expected responses

---

## Automated Testing (Future)

For continuous integration, consider adding:

1. **Jest tests** for React components
2. **Supertest** for API endpoint testing
3. **Cypress** or **Playwright** for E2E testing
4. **Image upload mock tests**
5. **Version history API tests**

Example test structure:
```javascript
describe('Image Upload', () => {
  it('should upload image successfully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should reject invalid file type', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});

describe('Version History', () => {
  it('should create revision on update', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should list all revisions', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
