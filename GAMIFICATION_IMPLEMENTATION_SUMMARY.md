## Security Measures

### Implemented
1. **Rate Limiting**: All routes protected (10-100 req/min)
2. **Input Validation**: Whitelist approach for query parameters
3. **File Upload**: Type and size restrictions (JPG/PNG/GIF, 2MB max)
4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies
5. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
6. **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
7. **SQL Injection**: Prevented via input sanitization

### Production Recommendations
1. Implement CSRF token validation
2. Add email verification
3. Enable HTTPS only
4. Implement monitoring/logging
5. Add account lockout after failed logins

## Styling

All components use **Atom Dark Theme**:
- Background: #282c34
- Green accents: #98c379
- Blue links: #61afef
- Text: #abb2bf, #5c6370
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Internationalization
